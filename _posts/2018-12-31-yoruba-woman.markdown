    A distant smell of Anachronism!! A beauty that brings enviable limits to the tides!
    Have you met a Yoruba woman?
    Bright Elegance , and blemish free eyes!
    <!--more-->
    You! Say nay; she meta to a leopard! Face the fury of Freya!
    Have you seen a Yoruba woman!
    She is morality and modernity in a single layer!

    Her charm, of Aphrodite in hologram!
    Smearing artillery of robes , a perfect frame of vivacity!
    A desirable surrender ! Of natures virility!
    A Yoruba woman! A morality ! Her knees filled in tides!
    As cold, as hot , as elements of a succeeding anagram!

    Palindromic in thoughts ! She is her children's mother!
    Wiggle Ass like an African Rhino ! She is yet a cinosure of men!
    Marry her! And drink from the river of life! Her husband's goddess , she is platinum!!
    Court her! And your future is set in stone; as vivid as adamantium !!!
