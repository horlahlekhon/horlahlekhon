<p><strong>He was sleeping on the floor</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was sitting on a rail</strong></p>
<p><strong>Down by the rail that have no sit</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Floor by the state that have no house</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hoisted like to give it all</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hosted on the dusty lane</strong></p>
<p><strong>He weeps even in his sleep</strong></p>
<p><strong>A sorrow of another day to leap</strong></p>
<p><strong>My effects on my back</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like a saddle on a horse</strong></p>
<p><strong>My weep saddling my pupils</strong></p>
<p><strong>Like a girdle round the haste</strong></p>

<br>

<p><strong>When would this trowel waters its own</strong></p>
<p><strong>When would this cloud bring the rain</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was sitting by a pass</strong></p>
<p><strong>Complaining how dirty my night was</strong></p>
<p><strong>He was sleeping on the walk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dirty flannel as a mat</strong></p>
<p><strong>He weeps in his sleep</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was guilty of living more satisfied than him</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the leader of tomorrow!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sleeping hopelessly on the walk</strong></p>
<p><strong>When would this stem get strong enough</strong></p>
<p><strong>To make its children climb aback</strong></p>

<br>

<p><strong>What am I ?; a man who complained he wasn't loved...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is he, a boy, passing through the hard torns</strong></p>
<p><strong>He woke up to the light</strong></p>
<p><strong>As I write this in tears</strong></p>
<p><strong>His arms already burned</strong></p>
<p><strong>My tears couldn't help</strong></p>
<p><strong>I burrowed to the outhouse!</strong></p>
<p><strong>As he borrowed another day!</strong></p>
