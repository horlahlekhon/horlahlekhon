<p><em>Last night I made a vow not to touch the lines.</em></p>

<p><em>A day before I was tied to a thread, a life.</em></p>

<p><em>And tomorrow might be the day I grow old.</em></p>

<p><em>But today shan't pass , a day I sing your praises.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<br>

<p><em>I don't sing a fancy of omnipotence!</em></p>

<p><em>Neither do I not say nay, when omniscience shows marvel!</em></p>

<p><em>But when a mortal weeps....</em></p>

<p><em>Maybe when she endure patriarchy to have you old!</em></p>

<p><em>Or when her urethra creaks as you stiff your tiny head</em></p>

<p><em>to walk the Earth...</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Let's sing the song of mortality !</em></p>

<p><em>Let the mage of the south beats upon the lushes..</em></p>

<p><em>On this day,</em></p>

<p><em>between the legs of oppressive patriarchs lays their egotistical bowl of manliness!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>And even the doublet scrotum takes a break of solitude!</em></p>

<p><em>To praise a mortal whose pain shine and shield forth life!</em></p>

<p><em>To hail a mortal whose tears pounds off infirmities</em></p>

<p><em>And whose love kills all ills.....</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>If I hadn't live last night , through her!</em></p>

<p><em>The day after wouldn't be the day I change the world!</em></p>

<p><em>If I hadn't walk toschool in her heels</em></p>

<p><em>Tomorrow wouldn't even worth the thirst!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>If I have promised the sea not to write it's peaceful praise again!</em></p>

<p><em>Forgive me o! Principality and honour my gem in their precious affinity !</em></p>

<p><em>On that day with a blank vista that always open to life!</em></p>

<p><em>She sat down besides me as I lay hibiscus on my father's grave ...</em></p>

<p><em>With my face buried deep into her Bossom!</em></p>

<p><em>Her love never makes me feel a trifle of loss!</em></p>

<p><em>If I and you would one day be the world !</em></p>

<p><em>Then, shouldn't today praise our mother than a saviour in the sky!</em></p>
