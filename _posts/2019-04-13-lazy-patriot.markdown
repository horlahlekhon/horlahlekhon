Heathen caven o'er !

Heaven caveat , sin at naught ; the message of eden.

Hell! Laudable , sad seed shall dwell.

Heated cry, worldly earth , FURY of the logos ! Unsheathed!!!
<!--more-->
Hades call, heaven I want , hell I gain in charades.

Hope lost, life of sin, eternal damnation down the rope.

Haven of joy! Afar of greatness , the most high is a maven.

Hide of the lions burn, the mother of harlots doom, child of Babylon brimstone belied.

Heap of joy , cry of sadness in eternity ; earthly work reaps.

High in promiscuity, healthy in sins, three score and ten ; the end of a well spent lie.
