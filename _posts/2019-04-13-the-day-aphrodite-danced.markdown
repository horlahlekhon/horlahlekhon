<p><em>Sunny traverse on a river bank! My legs yet sours</em></p>
<p><em>Sunscreens , battered , taciturn , body , wind laps</em></p>
<p><em>Follicle swerves; undulates! Spine gently rusks!</em></p>
<p><em>Golden rays on a sunny beach, the sun is yet to dusk!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Wiggle ! In the crowd, rotund waist; shroud like hamster!</em></p>
<p><em>Recherch√© bikini! Doused in carribean swagger!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold! Sophistication! She kills the sight of men!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>She is a repertoire of nature's skillful</em></p>
<p><em>When she took the dance! Habits of mastery she dabbles!</em></p>
<p><em>Sousing her sassy waist; left or right!! Query not! my eyes!</em></p>
<p><em>Neat pupils, a galaxy of expressions ; her charm! A tilt of fecundity!!</em></p>
<p><em>In lust it enchant men; blind , tiny and sepia, of Calypso!!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Narrow legs , as she danced , the sun bends In submission!</em></p>
<p><em>Behold her once or twice! Nature at its knees!!</em></p>
<p><em>For nature need not do! A transcient that torture the ascetic minds!</em></p>
<p><em>Sleek, silky skin, the echoes of her texture, a height of aesthetics!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>This beauty is NOT human!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>The golden sun crashes her party ! She is yet bioluminescent!</em></p>
<p><em>Her smile ! A touch of eupathy ! Ravenous! lavishing! Both esurient!</em></p>
<p><em>She wiggle here, her giggle there! Her gaze changes! we change</em></p>
<p><em>Men crave the subject of her gaze! Like a known accidence</em></p>
<p><em>What beauty is this? No! A fluxion of transcendence !</em></p>
<p><em>To the tune of nature she dance ; by the sonorousness of her charm!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Beauty in the dust ! Her lavender scarf fell to dust!</em></p>
<p><em>Deep in dust!! A red-carpet to another stage ? Of pulcritide that exceeds flaws!</em></p>
<p><em>Aphrodite will be jealous ! This is a breakdown of Zeus rage!</em></p>

<br>

<p><em>Dusk hits earth, red sun and dull sky, her stature still shines bold!</em></p>
<p><em>More than a thousands Picasso, her's is a bringer of hearty smile!</em></p>
<p><em>She danced ! Once more ; and my mouth has been opened!</em></p>
<p><em>Still serves hot, she wrap up to her man!!</em></p>
<p><em>A kiss of elegance to the face ! I have hoped she Never had a man!!.</em></p>
